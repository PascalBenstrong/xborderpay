## Getting Started
Before running the project we will need to prepare our environment with the following:

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- A free [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/) api key
- a local [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) instance or a cloud [MongoDb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) connection string
- A [Hedera test net account](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/getting-started/environment-set-up)

Once you have setup the above, you can go ahead an rename [example.env](./example.env) in the repository to `.env`.

| Environment variable |                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| MONGO_URL            | mongodb url or atlas url/connection string      |
| MONGO_USER           | database user that has access to the `MONGO_DB` |
| MONGO_PASSWORD       | database user password                          |
| MONGO_DB             | the name of the database to be used             |
| JWT_SECRET           | secret used to sign jwt tokens                  |
| JWT_ISSUER           | jwt issuer, default `xborderpay`                |
| JWT_AUDIENCE         | jwt audience `xborderpay`                       |
| RATES_API_KEY        | open change rates api key                       |
| HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID    | hedera test net account id                      |
| HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY   | hedera test net account private key             |


First install the node modules
```bash
pnpm i
```

Then you can run the dev build with
```bash
pnpm dev
```
The above command should start the project on port `3000` and the api and web interface can be accessed on the url [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deployment

We have chosen to deploy the project on vercel. However, since the project is built using nodejs, it can be deployed in any environment nodejs is allowed to run.
You will need to however build an optimized production build using `pnpm build`, after which you can use `pnpm start` to run the production build.
